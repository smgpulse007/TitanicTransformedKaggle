# README for Titanic Kaggle Beginner Project

## Project Overview

This project involves building a predictive model for the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic was transported based on various features. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble methods.

## Repository Contents

- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and the target variable.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset for which predictions are to be made.
- `submission.csv`: Output file with predictions on the test dataset.
- `titanic_model.py`: Python script with the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Features and Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering**: New features like `TotalExpenditure` and `CryoSleep_and_VIP` are created. Age and Total Expenditure are binned.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed using a `ColumnTransformer` that handles both numerical and categorical variables. Numerical data is imputed with the mean, and categorical data is imputed with the most frequent value and one-hot encoded.

## Models and Training

- **Base Models**: RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, and GradientBoostingClassifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV is used to find the best parameters for the RandomForestClassifier.
- **Ensemble Method**: A VotingClassifier with soft voting is used to combine the predictions of the three models.

## Evaluation

- The model is evaluated using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to ensure that each fold is representative of the class proportions.

## Usage

1. Ensure that Python and the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) are installed.
2. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the same directory as the script.
3. Run `titanic_model.py` to train the model and generate predictions.
4. `submission.csv` will be created with the predictions for the test dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost (optional)
- lightgbm (optional)

## Note

- The script `titanic_model.py` includes optional code for XGBoost and LightGBM models. These sections can be commented out if these libraries are not installed.
